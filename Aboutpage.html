        <h4>ABOUT ONLINE COURSE</h4>
        <div>
            <p>Online learning involves courses offered by primary institutions that are 100% virtual. 
            Online learning, or virtual classes offered over the internet, is contrasted with traditional courses taken in a brick-and-mortar school building.
                It is a development in distance education that expanded in the 1990s with the spread of the commercial Internet and the World Wide Web. 
                The learner experience is typically asynchronous but may also incorporate synchronous elements.
                The vast majority of institutions utilize a learning management system for the administration of online courses. 
                As theories of distance education evolve, digital technologies to support learning and pedagogy continue to transform as well.</p>

            Online credentials for learning are digital credentials that are offered in place of traditional paper credentials for a skill or educational achievement. 
            Directly linked to the accelerated development of internet communication technologies, the development of digital badges, 
            electronic passports and massive open online courses (MOOCs) have a very direct bearing on our understanding of learning,
            recognition and levels as they pose a direct challenge to the status quo. 
            It is useful to distinguish between three forms of online credentials: Test-based credentials, online badges, and online certificates.
