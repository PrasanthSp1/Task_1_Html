        <div>
            <p>SWAYAM is a programme initiated by Government of India and designed to achieve the three cardinal principles of Education Policy viz., 
            access, equity and quality.
            The objective of this effort is to take the best teaching learning resources to all, including the most disadvantaged.
            SWAYAM seeks to bridge the digital divide for students who have hitherto remained untouched by the digital revolution and have not been able to join the mainstream of the knowledge economy.</p>
            <p>
            This is done through a platform that facilitates hosting of all the courses, taught in classrooms from Class 9 till post-graduation to be accessed by anyone, anywhere at any time. All the courses are interactive, prepared by the best teachers in the country and are available, free of cost to any learner. More than 1,000 specially chosen faculty and teachers from across the country have participated in preparing these courses.
